# Advanced Problem: Pokémon Team Optimization

Welcome to the Advanced problem of the Analysis Arena! In this challenge, you will be working with the Pokémon dataset to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and solve a complex optimization problem. Below are the details and requirements for your submission.

## Dataset

You will use the Pokémon dataset, which includes various attributes for each Pokémon, such as their name, types, base stats, abilities, and more. Detailed information about the dataset can be found in the [data.md](data.md) file.

## Problem Statement

Your task is to explore the Pokémon dataset to uncover interesting insights and solve the following optimization problem:

### Objective

Develop a system to optimize a Pokémon team for battles based on various attributes, including types, base stats, and effectiveness against other types. The goal is to create a balanced and effective team of Pokémon that maximizes overall performance in battles.

### Tasks

#### Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
- **Effectiveness Features**: Create features representing the effectiveness of Pokémon against various types.
- **Composite Metrics**: Develop composite metrics for overall battle strength, considering attributes like attack, defense, speed, and special stats.
- **Synergy Scores**: Generate synergy scores for potential team combinations based on complementary strengths and weaknesses.

#### Team Composition Optimization
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Implement an algorithm to select an optimal team of 6 Pokémon from the dataset.
- **Balance and Effectiveness**: Ensure the team is balanced across different types and maximizes overall effectiveness in battles.
- **Constraints**: Consider constraints such as avoiding over-reliance on a single type and ensuring diversity in attack and defense capabilities.

#### Predictive Modeling (Optional)
- **Battle Outcome Simulation**: Build predictive models to simulate battle outcomes based on team composition.
- **Training and Prediction**: Use historical data and battle simulations to train the models and predict the performance of different team combinations.

#### Evaluation and Validation
- **Model Metrics**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for predicting battle outcomes.
- **Algorithm Validation**: Validate the optimization algorithm by testing it against known effective teams and benchmark strategies.

#### Interpretability and Insights
- **Feature Importance**: Use interpretability tools to understand which features most influence battle outcomes.
- **Key Insights**: Provide insights into the key factors that contribute to an effective Pokémon team.

#### Presentation and Communication
- **Clear Presentation**: Clearly present the optimization approach, model results, and insights.
- **Visual Aids**: Use effective visual aids to illustrate the optimization process and outcomes.

## Suggested Questions to Explore

Here are some questions to guide your analysis. You can choose to answer any of these or come up with your own unique questions:

- How are the base stats distributed across different Pokémon types?
- Are there any significant differences in base stats between generations?
- What are the most common primary and secondary types among all Pokémon?
- How do the heights and weights of Pokémon vary across different types and generations?
- Are there any patterns or trends in the capture rates of Pokémon?
- How do the base stats of legendary Pokémon compare to non-legendary Pokémon?
- What are the relationships between different base stats (e.g., HP vs. Defense)?
- How do different abilities impact the overall effectiveness of Pokémon in battles?

## Choosing a Unique Area of Focus

Participants are encouraged to choose a unique area to focus on and assert reasoning over some aspect of the data that would be useful for other people to know. Here are some guidelines:

- **Identify a Specific Question or Hypothesis**: Think of a unique question or hypothesis that you want to explore. This could be related to a specific attribute, a combination of attributes, or a pattern you noticed in the data.
- **Provide Context and Relevance**: Explain why this question or hypothesis is interesting or important. How could the insights be useful for other Pokémon enthusiasts or researchers?
- **Use Clear Visualizations**: Create visualizations that clearly communicate your findings. Ensure that your visualizations are easy to understand and interpret.
- **Summarize for Non-Technical Stakeholders**: Write a summary of your findings in a way that is accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Avoid using Python code or technical jargon unless it's clearly explained. Focus on the insights and their implications.

## Requirements

  - Use a variety of plots such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to present your findings.
- **Advanced Insights**:
  - Summarize the key insights from your EDA. Discuss any interesting patterns, correlations, or anomalies you discovered.
  - Compare and contrast different generations of Pokémon.
  - Analyze the relationship between Pokémon types and their base stats.
