# Beginner Problem: Pokémon Data Analysis

Welcome to the Beginner problem of the Analysis Arena! In this challenge, you will be working with the Pokémon dataset to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Optionally, you can also develop a predictive model. Below are the details and requirements for your submission.

## Dataset

You will use the Pokémon dataset, which includes various attributes for each Pokémon, such as their name, types, base stats, abilities, and more. Detailed information about the dataset can be found in the [data.md](data.md) file.

## Problem Statement

Your task is to explore the Pokémon dataset to uncover interesting insights. Specifically, you need to:

1. **Perform In-Depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize distributions of Pokémon attributes such as types, base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.), and generation.
   - Identify any interesting patterns or correlations in the data.
   - Present your findings with clear visualizations and descriptions.

2. **Optional: Build a Predictive Model**:
   - Develop a predictive model to classify Pokémon as either legendary or non-legendary based on their attributes.
   - You may use any classification algorithm you are comfortable with (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.).
   - Evaluate your model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

## Suggested Questions to Explore

Here are some questions to guide your analysis. You can choose to answer any of these or come up with your own unique questions:

- How are the base stats distributed across different Pokémon types?
- Are there any significant differences in base stats between generations?
- What are the most common primary and secondary types among all Pokémon?
- How do the heights and weights of Pokémon vary across different types and generations?
- Are there any patterns or trends in the capture rates of Pokémon?
- How do the base stats of legendary Pokémon compare to non-legendary Pokémon?
- What are the relationships between different base stats (e.g., HP vs. Defense)?

## Choosing a Unique Area of Focus

Participants are encouraged to choose a unique area to focus on and assert reasoning over some aspect of the data that would be useful for other people to know. Here are some guidelines:

- **Identify a Specific Question or Hypothesis**: Think of a unique question or hypothesis that you want to explore. This could be related to a specific attribute, a combination of attributes, or a pattern you noticed in the data.
- **Provide Context and Relevance**: Explain why this question or hypothesis is interesting or important. How could the insights be useful for other Pokémon enthusiasts or researchers?
- **Use Clear Visualizations**: Create visualizations that clearly communicate your findings. Ensure that your visualizations are easy to understand and interpret.
- **Summarize for Non-Technical Stakeholders**: Write a summary of your findings in a way that is accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Avoid using Python code or technical jargon unless it's clearly explained. Focus on the insights and their implications.

## Requirements

### In-Depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Data Understanding**:
  - Provide a clear overview of the dataset, including the number of Pokémon, the types of attributes, and any missing values.
- **Detailed Visualizations**:
  - Create visualizations to show the distribution of types, base stats, and other relevant attributes.
  - Use a variety of plots such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to present your findings.
- **Advanced Insights**:
  - Summarize the key insights from your EDA. Discuss any interesting patterns, correlations, or anomalies you discovered.
  - Compare and contrast different generations of Pokémon.
  - Analyze the relationship between Pokémon types and their base stats.
  - Explore how attributes like weight, height, and abilities correlate with base stats.

### Optional Predictive Modeling

- **Model Selection**:
  - Choose an appropriate classification algorithm for your model.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Select relevant features for your model. You may consider creating new features if necessary.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**:
  - Train your model using a portion of the dataset (e.g., 80% for training, 20% for testing).
  - Evaluate your model's performance on the test set and provide metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Explanation**:
  - Explain the rationale behind your model selection and feature choices.
  - Discuss the performance of your model and any potential improvements.

## Requirements for All Submissions

### Documentation
- **Clear and Concise Report**:
  - Document your analysis and findings in a clear and concise manner. Include code snippets, visualizations, and explanations.
- **Formatting**:
  - Ensure your submission follows the specified formatting guidelines, with no extraneous debug/print statements and all solutions and visuals rendered.
  
### GitHub Repository
- **Upload**:
  - Upload your work to a GitHub repository. Ensure your repository is publicly accessible.
  - Provide a direct link to your GitHub repository and the Jupyter notebook file in your submission post.
